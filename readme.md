## Yosemite Falls Trail Map
This is a map I made in VS Code that details the popular hiking trail in Yosemite National Park. This trail leads up to the top of the famous waterfall in the park which is about a 7 hour round trip and a 2,700 feet elevation gain.

-----

The map features a dashed route that shows the full extent of the hike starting at the bus station that drops tourists off near the trailhead, and ends at the beautiful waterfall. There are several markers on the map that show the starting point at the bus stop, Columbia Rock, which is a great viewpoint for hikers that cannot make it to the top, another viewpoint for the falls were you can feel the mist from the water depending on the season, and the final marker shows the end of the trail.
